# AuctionTime

An auction website which I wrote for my SENG365 project. The backend (or middleware) is written using Express.js and the frontend in React.js.


## Getting started
1. Please refer to the README file in the backend and then get the backend running first.
2. Then run the frontend. Similarly, there is a README.

## Deployment
The most straightforward way to deploy this tool is to use Firebase to host both the frontend and the backend.

For the persistent layer, host your MySQL database on a VPS. Alternatively, you can rewrite "Model" scripts in the backend to make it suitable for a Microsoft SQL as Azure offers cheaper pricing than running an entire VPS on the Cloud through DigitalOcean.
